# Web Interface Requirements


This document captures the requirements for the web interface example.

## View Project Structure
- The interface exposes an endpoint `GET /projects/:prid/struct`.
- The endpoint returns a nested structure describing the project, including:
  - Product data.
  - Project metadata.
  - Requirements.
- Clients fetch this structure and pass it to the DOM for rendering.

## Query Parameters
- `GET /projects/:prid/struct` accepts optional query parameters:
  - `depth` – limit the maximum depth of nested requirements.
  - `status` – filter requirements by their status (e.g. active, deleted).
  - `page` – select a page of paginated results.
- When no query parameters are provided, the entire project structure is returned.

## Data Format
- Responses are JSON objects where nested arrays or maps represent hierarchy.
- All fields required by the DOM must be included and use stable names.

## Performance
- Requests for the project structure should complete within typical network latency (≤1s).
- The server should limit payload size by excluding unnecessary data.

## Security
- The endpoint requires authentication.
- Sanitize all fields before injecting into the DOM to prevent XSS.

## Reference
See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the overall system diagram and endpoint mappings.
